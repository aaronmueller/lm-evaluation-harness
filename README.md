# BabyLM Evaluation Pipeline
![BabyLM Challenge](assets/babylm.png)

## Overview

This code provides the backend for the BabyLM Challenge's evaluation pipeline. 

We provide support for zero-shot evaluations on BLiMP, as well as scripts for fine-tuning HuggingFace-based models on GLUE tasks.

We also provide a [Colab demo](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1HX2D3wztO81tKcqCeV_ecRcEUseBVuTc?usp=sharing) of the evaluation pipeline as a demonstration of how to use the code.

If you have questions about or suggestions for this code, please contact Aaron Mueller. We also welcome pull requests!

## Installation

This code assumes you have access using a GPU enabled for CUDA 11.3. Other CUDA versions should work as long as the `torch` and `transformers` versions are sufficiently up-to-date.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bigscience-workshop/lm-evaluation-harness
cd lm-evaluation-harness
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pip install torch==1.11.0+cu113 torchvision==0.12.0+cu113 torchaudio==0.11.0 promptsource==0.2.3 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu113
```

### Data
We provide versions of BLiMP and GLUE which have been filtered according to the vocabulary of the `strict-small` dataset. We filter for examples where each word has appeared in our training set at least twice.

Unzip the dataset into the root directory of this repository: `unzip filter_data.zip`.

## Usage
### Zero-shot Evaluation
To evaluate a model on zero-shot tasks like BLiMP:

```bash
python babylm_eval.py 'path/to/model_and_tokenizer' 'model_type'
```

Where `model_type` is one of "encoder", "decoder" or "encoder-decoder".

### Fine-tuning
To fine-tune and evaluate a model on tasks that require fine-tuning, like the (Super)GLUE tasks:

```bash
./finetune_all_tasks.sh 'path/to/model_and_tokenizer'
```

#### Hyperparameters
This script contains hyperparameter defaults that should work for a variety of model sizes, architectures, and tasks. You may adjust these hyperparameters as you wish, though we ask that you submit the best hyperparmeter settings in a README file if you don't use the defaults.

Here are the defaults that we use:
| Hyperparameter | Value |
| -------------- | ----- |
| Initial learning rate | 5e-5 |
| Batch size | 64 |
| Maximum epochs | 10 |
| Evaluate every (steps) | 200 |
| Patience | 10 |
| Random seed | 12 |

## Uploading Results
We provide a shell script that will collect your results into a single file:

```bash
./collect_results.sh path/to/model_and_tokenizer
```

We will ask you to share your results, model, and tokenizer. We will evaluate on held-out tasks (TBA) as part of the final evaluation.

## Baselines
We provide a series of baseline models that we train on our strict or strict-small datasets. These are [hosted on HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/babylm).

We simply take the hyperparameters used to pre-train the original versions of these models, and train them on our strict or strict-small datasets. While we do reduce the context length and, in some cases, the batch size, these are otherwise minimally modified.

These are na√Øve baselines that are meant to provide a starting point for investigation. We look forward to seeing how you will improve upon these!
